1. Explain about the different complex data types in pig
Ans.
Complex Types: Pig supports three complex data types. They are listed below: 
Tuple : An ordered set of fields. Tuple is represented by braces. Example: (1,2)
(Field: A field is a piece of data. In the above data set product_name is a field.)
Bag : A set of tuples is called a bag. Bag is represented by flower or curly braces. Example: {(1,2),(3,4)}
Map : A set of key value pairs. Map is represented in a square brackets. Example: [key#value] . The # is used to separate key and value.

2. How can you interact with the shell in Apache pig
Ans.
a)After invoking the Grunt shell, you can run your Pig scripts in the shell. In addition to that, there are certain useful shell and 
utility commands provided by the Grunt shell.
b)The Grunt shell of Apache Pig is mainly used to write Pig Latin scripts. Prior to that, we can invoke any shell commands using sh and fs.

3. Explain how pig differs from Map reduce
Ans.
PIG is a data flow language, the key focus of Pig is manage the flow of data from input source to output store.
As part of managing this data flow it moves data feeding it to process1, taking output and feeding it to process2.
The core features are preventing execution of subsequent stages if previous stage fails, manages temporary storage of data
and most importantly compresses and rearranges processing steps for faster processing. 
While this can be done for any kind of processing tasks Pig is written specifically for managing data flow of Map reduce type of jobs.
Most if not all jobs in a Pig are map reduce jobs or data movement jobs. Pig allows for custom functions to be added which can be 
used for processing in Pig, some default ones are like ordering, grouping, distinct, count etc.
    Map reduce on the other hand is a data processing paradigm, it is a framework for application developers to write code in so that 
its easily scaled to PB of tasks, this creates a separation between the developer that writes the application vs the developer 
that scales the application. Not all applications can be migrated to Map reduce but good few can be including complex ones like 
k-means to simple ones like counting uniques in a dataset.

4. Explain how pig differs from sql
Ans.
a)SQL is declarative and Pig is procedural to a large extent.
b)SQL is a general purpose database language that has extensively been used for both transactional and analytical queries.
c)Pig can process both structured and unstructured data. It is a data flow language and environment for exploring very large datasets.

5. Explain the scalar data types in pig
Ans.
Scalar Data Types: The sccalar datatypes are also called as simple datatypes. The simple data types that pig supports are: 
int : It is signed 32 bit integer. This is similar to the Integer in java.
long : It is a 64 bit signed integer. This is similar to the Long in java.
float : It is a 32 bit floating point. This data type is similar to the Float in java.
double : It is a 63 bit floating pint. This data type is similar to the Double in java.
chararray : It is character array in unicode UTF-8 format. This corresponds to java's String object.
bytearray : Used to represent bytes. It is the default data type. If you don't specify a data type for a filed, then bytearray datatype is assigned for the field.
boolean : to represent true/false values.
